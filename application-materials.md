These are various application materials from when I applied to grad school,
openly published here to encourage and assist others when doing the same. Feel
free to use my LaTeX source files to generate your own documents if you would
like.

Statement of Purpose
--------------------

Endless thanks to Ethan Fast for his blog post [State Your
Purpose](http://ethanfast.com/2011/04/state-your-purpose/) and [Jean
Yang](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jeanyang/) for [publishing her statement of
purpose](https://github.com/jeanqasaur/academic-application-materials/blob/master/phd-application-2007/personal_statement.pdf). I
found both of these very useful for understanding the tone and content of an
effective statement of purpose.<br/>

Transcripts
--------

I'm told that my 0.71 GPA from RIT set a low score record for accepted CMU ISR
Ph.D. students; I find endless amusement in this. Lesson: there is very little
that you can't recover from, worry about what you're doing _now_ rather than
what mistakes you may have made in the past. My UVA grades were also not
fantastic, but at that point I knew that developing and demonstrating research
skills was more important than perfect academic performance.<br/>

Resume
------

This is the resume that I sent out with my applications (except the address and
phone number have been changed). This is not my current resume, but it should
give you an idea of what worked for grad school.<br/>

GRE
---
*Important update for 2020:* Many schools are starting to drop the GRE
requirement (including CMU ISR). Make sure you check to see if the schools you
are applying to require them, if none of them require it I advise not even
taking it.

I didn't study at all for the GREs and went in completely cold. I pretty much
bombed the writing portion, but it's pretty clear that having a coherent
statement of purpose and/or having written a paper is more important to
admissions committees than standardized test scores.

* Verbal:       162 - 91st percentile
* Quantitative: 169 - 96th percentile
* Writing:      3.5 - 41st percentile

Schools
-------

Here's the list of the schools I applied to and their response:

* CMU - A
* Cornell - R
* Princeton - R
* Georgia Tech - A
* University of Maryland - N
* Harvard - R
* Duke - R*
* UNC - A
* UVa - A
* NC State - A
* UMass Amherst - A
* SUNY Stony Brook - A
* Penn - R
* Michigan - N
* Delaware - A

Key:<br/>
  A: Accept<br/>
  R: Reject<br/>
  N: No Response

*Duke does a strange thing where you're first invited to a pre-admission visit
 and that serves both as a visit day and an admission interview. I spoke with
 two different professors over Skype and am pretty sure that they would have
 admitted me had I gone to the visit.

Application Fees
----------------

Applying to as many schools as I did was very expensive (approx. $2,000). *Do
not let this discourage you from applying.* At the time I did not know about
application fee waivers, which I likely would have been eligible for. Most
schools offer these, and from what I understand they are usually generous about
them. If you think you'd be eligible, you probably are.
