About Me
========

I am a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow in the [Software and Societal Systems
Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu) (formerly the Institute for Software Research)
at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am interested in the (automated) maintenance, debugging,
and reverse-engineering of software. I have extensive experience using machine-learning models to automatically generate and modify existing codebases.

I earned my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from CMU as a member of two research
groups: [STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io/), with my co-advisor [Bogdan
Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/), and
[squaresLab](https://squareslab.github.io/), with my co-advisor [Claire Le
Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/).

Before my Ph.D., I earned a B.A. in Computer Science from the [University of
Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) and an A.S. in Computer Science from
[Piedmont Virginia Community College](https://www.pvcc.edu/). Before grad school
I had various jobs in fields as diverse as restaurant management, book binding,
and MRI service.

*I am currently on the job market in Pittsburgh, PA!*
