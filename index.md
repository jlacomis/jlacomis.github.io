About Me
========

I am a Ph. D. student in the [Institute for Software
Research](http://www.isri.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon
University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am a member of two research groups:
[STRUDEL](https://cmustrudel.github.io/), with my co-advisor [Bogdan
Vasilescu](https://bvasiles.github.io/) and
[squaresLab](https://squareslab.github.io/), with my co-advisor [Claire Le
Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/). I am interested in maintenance, debugging,
and reverse-engineering of software.

I have a B.A., Computer Science from the [University of
Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) and an A.S., Computer Science from [Piedmont
Virginia Community College](https://www.pvcc.edu/). Before school I had
various jobs in fields as diverse as restaurant management, book binding, and
MRI service.
